          <span class="title-project">ABOUT ME</span>
          <p>Third years ago I saw the first light of day. In my early days I spent a good deal amount on software development; developing and coding all over the place. Over the years I developed a questionably excessive interest and curiosity towards computers, with video games especially . I was always wondering how they were made, and spent more time in development than game designing. That curiosity turned me into what I am today, a creative professional yet still eager to learn more tricks of the trade.</p>
            <p>In 2023 I am about to receive my bachelor's degree Computer Engineering at the Duzce University of Engineering Faculty. That was just the start as I had to keep improving myself as the industry moved forward. A very welcome challenge!</p>
            <p>I've been learning many things along the way, gathered new insights and different techniques. New engines, new tools, new languages, improved my programing ability. In my spare time I sometimes work on personal projects, varying from commercial projects to small hobby projects - either way I'm always learning.</p><img alt="" class="rsTmb" src="images/me.jpg">
